# Data Privacy

## Purpose
The purpose of this document is to summarize the key privacy and security expectations relevant to this project and to outline the requirements for responsibly accessing and handling any SkySpark data.

## Personal Information (PI)
Personal Information is defined as any recorded information about an identifiable individual other than basic contact information. Examples of basic contact information includes:
- name, position or title, business telephone number, business address, or business email of the individual.

## How Privacy Applies to This Project
This project uses SkySpark to analyze and visualize building-level energy and water consumption data provided by UBC Facilities. The following commitments and procedures apply to ensure data privacy:

Our responsibilities include:
- **Authorized Use:** Data is used solely for approved project purposes (such as operational analytics and campus sustainability research).
- **Restriction of Disclosure:** Access and sharing are limited to project members, campus partners, or researchers with permission, and are always based on a strict need-to-know principle.
- **Secure Storage:** All data handled by this project is stored using UBC-approved systems and protected from unauthorized access, loss, or misuse.
- **Data Retention:** Data is retained only as long as necessary for project goals and is subject to regular review.
- **Compliance:** All data use complies with UBC Facilities’ privacy policy, relevant university guidelines, and FIPPA statutory requirements.

Even with non-personal building data, this approach helps protect the interests of both UBC and its community, ensuring transparency and accountability.
